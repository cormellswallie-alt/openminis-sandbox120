 *
 * fake_netlink: emulate an rtnetlink socket inside an unprivileged Android
 * app sandbox.
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * Android runs third-party apps in the SELinux `untrusted_app` domain, which
 * is not permitted to create an AF_NETLINK/NETLINK_ROUTE socket. The refusal
 * happens in the REAL kernel, before PRoot's ptrace stop has any say in it, so
 * the guest sees a bare EPERM:
 *
 *     route ip+net: netlinkrib: permission denied
 *
 * Go's net.Interfaces() reaches this through syscall.NetlinkRIB(), so anything
 * that enumerates interfaces (tailscale/tsnet is how we found it) fails at
 * startup even though it would be perfectly happy to learn that there are no
 * interfaces at all.
 *
 * ## Why this can be emulated at all
 *
 * PRoot is not a kernel, so it cannot make the real kernel say yes. What it
 * CAN do is decline to forward a syscall: writing PR_void into the syscall
 * number register at ptrace-enter makes the kernel execute a harmless no-op,
 * and PRoot then supplies the result itself at ptrace-exit (see the
 * SYSCALL_AVOIDER block in syscall/exit.c:74-86). `fake_id0` already fakes a
 * whole family of privileged calls this way ("These syscalls are fully
 * emulated", fake_id0.c:699-701), so the mechanism is load-bearing and
 * long-standing rather than something invented here.
 *
 * ## The one thing we do NOT fabricate: the fd
 *
 * A fabricated fd number would be a lie the rest of the system can detect —
 * poll/epoll/fcntl/dup/fork would all consult the real kernel about a
 * descriptor that does not exist there. So `socket(AF_NETLINK, …)` is turned
 * into a REAL `socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)` executed by the tracee
 * itself: the guest ends up holding a genuine kernel fd with ordinary
 * semantics, and only the DATA flowing over it is ours. This is the same
 * trick the iSH port used, for the same reason.
 *
 * Because that substitution needs a second syscall in the tracee, it is done
 * with PRoot's existing syscall-chaining machinery rather than by voiding.
 *
 * ## Scope of the emulation
 *
 * Deliberately minimal, matching what iSH shipped: RTM_GETLINK and
 * RTM_GETADDR are answered with an EMPTY interface list (just NLMSG_DONE).
 * "No interfaces" is a state every correct caller must already handle, which
 * is why an empty answer is safer than a fabricated eth0 that does not exist:
 * a caller that tries to bind to invented addresses would fail later and in a
 * much more confusing way. Everything that is not a NETLINK_ROUTE socket is
 * untouched and keeps going to the real kernel.
